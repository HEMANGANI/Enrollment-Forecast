# Enrollment-Forecast

### Goal: 
ML model that predicts the headcount of male and female students enrolled in various graduate and undergraduate programs in a year. 
### Introduction: 
In today’s society, the superior training of human resources is a necessity. With more and more occupations requiring advanced education, a college degree is critical to one’s success in the workforce and towards leading a better quality of life. Many graduate from college with a sense of accomplishment and discipline, some realize their passion along the way, and almost all, leave with heightened communication and responsibility. However, several socio-economic factors prevent a person from going to college or dropping out in between. Gender is one such factor that has been brought under the scanner recently, with universities trying their best to fix the skewed gender ratios on their campuses by encouraging more women to apply.
### Motivation: 
Colleges are increasingly interested in identifying the factors that maximize and minimize their enrollment. These factors allow enrollment management administrators to identify the applicants who have a higher tendency to enroll at their institutions and reach out to them and allocate their money rewards (i.e., scholarship and financial aid) towards encouraging those who enroll in smaller amounts. It helps the institution to make necessary changes, such as building new girls' hostels and having a committee to help international students. On the whole, the university can diversify its student set and provide a more holistic educational environment.
### Metric: 
The evaluation metric for this is root-mean-square error (RMSE). RMSE is a frequently used measure of the differences between values (sample or population values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values observed.

# Machine Learning Forecast Model for Headcount Prediction Using XGBoost

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for building a machine learning forecast model using XGBoost to predict headcount based on a provided dataset. The model is trained on historical data and then used to make predictions on unseen test data.

## Contents
- `train data.csv`: CSV file containing training data.
- `test data.csv`: CSV file containing test data.
- `forecast_model.py`: Python script for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `result.csv`: CSV file containing the predictions generated by the model.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## Usage
1. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed on your system.
2. Place the training data (`train data.csv`) and test data (`test data.csv`) in the same directory as the `forecast_model.py` script.
3. Run the `forecast_model.py` script using a Python interpreter.
4. After execution, the script will generate a file named `result.csv` containing the predictions.
5. View and analyze the predictions in the `result.csv` file.

## Additional Notes
- The `forecast_model.py` script contains comments explaining each step of the process, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- Adjust hyperparameters and preprocessing steps as needed to optimize the model performance.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
