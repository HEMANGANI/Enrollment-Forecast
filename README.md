# Enrollment-Forecast

## Goal: 
ML model that predicts the headcount of male and female students enrolled in various graduate and undergraduate programs in a year. 

Introduction: In today’s society, the superior training of human resources is a necessity. With more and more occupations requiring advanced education, a college degree is not only critical to one’s success in the workforce but also towards leading a better quality of life. Many graduate from college with a sense of accomplishment and discipline, some realize their passion along the way, and almost all, leave with heightened communication and responsibility. However, there are several socio-economic factors that prevent a person from going to college or dropping out in between. Gender is one such factor that has been brought under the scanner recently with universities trying their best to fix the skewed gender ratios on their campuses by encouraging more women to apply.

Motivation: Colleges are increasingly interested in identifying the factors that maximize and minimize their enrollment. These factors allow enrollment management administrators to identify the applicants who have a higher tendency to enroll at their institutions and reach out to them as well as allocate their money rewards (i.e.,scholarship and financial aid) towards encouraging those who enroll in smaller amounts. It helps the institution to make necessary changes such as building new girls' hostels and having a committee to help international students. On the whole, the university can diversify its student set and provide a more holistic educational environment.

Metric: The evaluation metric for this is root-mean-square error (RMSE). RMSE is a frequently used measure of the differences between values (sample or population values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values observed.
